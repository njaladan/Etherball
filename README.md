## Features
Etherball features:

 â€¢ Easy to purchase ticket interface (and prevention of duplicate tickets)  

 â€¢ Works with the Metamask wallet and Mist browser  

 â€¢ A simple but functional front-end built with Bootstrap  

 â€¢ Integration with all major Ethereum testnets

 â€¢ A blockchain-based randomness generator to ensure fairness

 â€¢ Real-time ether to USD converter

## Technologies Used
 â€¢ [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle)  

 â€¢ [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node)

 â€¢ [TestRPC](https://github.com/pipermerriam/eth-testrpc)  

 â€¢ [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)  

 â€¢ [Web3](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/)

## Installation
Installing Etherball to use on your machine is simple. First,  

`git clone`  

the repository. Next, navigate to the cloned directory and install the necessary Node.js modules with  

`npm install`  

Create and place your 12-word mnemonic private key at the location  

`keystore/eth_keystore.txt`  

Initialize a local blockchain with

`testrpc`

and deploy the smart contract with

`truffle migrate`  

Finally, to open the web app,  

`npm run dev`


## Miscellaneous
 â€¢ The majority of the code powering the app is located in `contracts/Lottery.sol` and `src/js/app.js` - if you'd like to see how the app works in any way, that's probably the place to go.

 â€¢ The source of randomness for this lottery system comes from a SHA-256 hash taken from the blockchain timestamp and number.

 â€¢ Feel free to submit a pull request if you have any changes or suggestions to make. :)
